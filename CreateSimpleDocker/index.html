    <p>Docker is one of the best containerization tools available. It is well maintained, very dynamic, and easy to use once you get the hang of it. Furthermore, there are lots of tutorials out there for uses to use. That being said, I noticed that every tutorial has a little piece missing or tend to go into some topics a little to deep. The goal of this article is to create a complete and to the point tutorial to cover the basics, and only the basics, of how to create a simple docker container from a python app in the shortest time possible. While avoiding technical stuff as much as possible.</p><p>This tutorial assumes the bsic knowledge of MS Windows 10 and Python. I may upload a Java version someday. But for now, this should do.</p><p>If you find any mistakes in this article or there is anything you want to add, feel free fix/add them yourself or message me.
